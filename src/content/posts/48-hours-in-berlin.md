## Travel Tips for First-Time Berlin Visitors

- **Walking:** Berlin is quite spread out. While walking in neighborhoods is pleasant, use public transport between major areas to save time and energy.
- **History Context:** Berlin was divided by the Wall from 1961-1989. East Berlin (Soviet sector) included Alexanderplatz and Museum Island, while West Berlin included areas like Charlottenburg. This division still influences the city's character.
- **Weather Preparedness:** Berlin weather can be unpredictable. Even in summer, bring a light jacket and be prepared for sudden rain showers.
- **Cash & Cards:** While credit cards are increasingly accepted, many smaller establishments still prefer cash. Always have some Euros on hand.
- **Cultural Etiquette:** Germans value punctuality, direct communication, and respect for rules. Standing on the left side of escalators (blocking those walking up) is considered very impolite!
