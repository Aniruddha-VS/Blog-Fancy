## Day 1: Cultural Treasures and Coastal Views

### Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate de Nice

**Address:** [Place Rossetti, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/DEfzxGgkK3uRBt1j8)

Begin your Nice adventure in the heart of the Old Town (Vieux Nice) at this stunning 17th-century cathedral. Named after the city's patron saint, this baroque masterpiece features an ornate interior with ten chapels and a magnificent dome. For first-time European travelers, this cathedral offers a perfect introduction to the religious architecture that defines so many European cities. The vibrant Rossetti Square outside is alive with cafés and gelaterias, giving you that quintessential European plaza experience.

### Musée du Palais Lascaris

**Address:** [15 Rue Droite, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/V7r4yUAUzPZfF7pQ8)

Just a short walk from the cathedral, step back in time at this 17th-century baroque palace turned museum. The Palais Lascaris houses an impressive collection of musical instruments and offers a glimpse into aristocratic life in Nice's past. The ornate staircase and frescoed ceilings will transport you to another era. For first-timers to Europe, this museum provides an intimate look at the opulence of historical European nobility without the overwhelming crowds of larger museums.

### Chez Thérésa (MUST)

**Address:** [28 Rue Droite, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/KYVMPZdj9dJ2MiWy9)

By now, you'll have worked up an appetite! This legendary local institution is famous for its socca—a chickpea pancake that's a Nice specialty. The casual, no-frills atmosphere gives you an authentic taste of local life. Don't be intimidated by the French menu; point if necessary, and remember that "un petit morceau de socca, s'il vous plaît" (a small piece of socca, please) is all you need to know! This is the kind of hidden gem that transforms a tourist experience into a traveler's discovery.

### Colline du Château (Castle Hill)

**Address:** [Montée du Château, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/qBwvXH9KNPq9TM7VA)

After lunch, make your way to what many consider Nice's most spectacular viewpoint. Despite its name, the castle is long gone, but the panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea, the Promenade des Anglais, and the terracotta rooftops of Old Nice are absolutely breathtaking. Take the stairs for a workout or the free elevator if you're feeling less energetic. The artificial waterfall and shaded gardens provide a refreshing respite from the Mediterranean sun. Don't miss the Point de vue Colline du Château for the most Instagram-worthy photos of your trip.

### Fenocchio

**Address:** [2 Place Rossetti, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/DM7vL3qCMsRSDW766)

Return to Place Rossetti to reward yourself with what many consider the best ice cream in Nice. Fenocchio offers almost 100 flavors, including local specialties like lavender, thyme, and olive oil. This is no ordinary gelato stop—it's a cultural institution that's been delighting locals and visitors alike since 1966. Enjoying a cone while people-watching in the square is a quintessential Nice experience.

### Place Garibaldi

**Address:** [Place Garibaldi, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/XvjnwFNpNCFE5dCM9)

End your first day at this elegant 18th-century square named after the Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in Nice when it was part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The square's uniform ochre buildings and arcades epitomize Niçois architectural style. As evening falls, the square comes alive with locals and visitors enjoying drinks and dinner at the many surrounding cafés and restaurants. It's the perfect spot to observe the seamless blend of French and Italian influences that make Nice so unique.

## Day 2: Spiritual Journeys and Seaside Splendor

### Cathédrale Saint-Nicolas de Nice

**Address:** [Avenue Nicolas II, 06000 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/jRnELg7nMsdhb6tW8)

Start your second day with a visit to this stunning Russian Orthodox cathedral, the largest outside Russia. With its colorful onion domes and ornate interior, this architectural marvel stands in striking contrast to the French baroque styles you explored yesterday. Built in 1912 for Russian aristocrats who wintered in Nice, it's a reminder of the city's cosmopolitan history and appeal to European nobility. The intricate icons and detailed mosaics offer first-time European travelers a glimpse into Eastern Orthodox traditions rarely seen in Western Europe.

### HOBO COFFEE

**Address:** [10 Rue Lascaris, 06300 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/Hm8zbj8tEJdaKCPt5)

After an early morning of sightseeing, recharge at this trendy café that locals love. Unlike the traditional French cafés you'll find throughout Nice, HOBO offers third-wave coffee creations and Instagram-worthy brunch options. The minimalist design and friendly English-speaking staff make this an accessible and comfortable spot for first-time visitors to Europe who might be experiencing culture shock or language barriers.

### Jardin Albert 1er

**Address:** [Promenade des Anglais, 06000 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/AGXeUkPYMCZoHKSs8)

Take a leisurely stroll through Nice's oldest public garden, established in 1852. This verdant oasis between the bustling city and the Mediterranean Sea features exotic plants, fountains, and sculptures. Don't miss the Centenary Monument commemorating Nice's 100th anniversary as part of France. The garden provides a perfect transition to the iconic Promenade des Anglais, which runs alongside it.

### Basilique Notre-Dame de l'Assomption

**Address:** [37 Avenue Jean Médecin, 06000 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/yKnM4RjCqvpT1wmy6)

This neo-Gothic basilica might be less famous than the cathedral, but its striking pink-and-grey façade and twin spires make it one of Nice's most beautiful religious buildings. Built between 1864 and 1879, its design was inspired by the great Gothic cathedrals of medieval France. Inside, marvel at the stunning rose windows and the sense of soaring space. For first-time European travelers, this basilica offers an excellent example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture that defined much of Europe's urban renewal during this period.

### Patisserie Julien Dugourd

**Address:** [17 Rue Gubernatis, 06000 Nice, France](https://goo.gl/maps/qWQ7Lm9QhB1JVWQt7)

No trip to France is complete without indulging in some world-class pastries! This celebrated pâtisserie showcases the artistry of French dessert-making. Chef Julien Dugourd's creations are not just delicious but visually stunning—perfect for those social media posts that will make friends back home jealous. Try the lemon tart or Paris-Brest for a classic French experience.

### Promenade des Anglais & Sunset Finale

End your 48 hours in Nice with a classic: a sunset stroll along the famous Promenade des Anglais.
